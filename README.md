# Excel VBA Compilation
Even VBA making it to the top dreaded language in the recent StackOverflow survey, it's still very useful to my job today.
 
I'm creating this repository with scripts and functions for future personal use (So I don't have to dig through 2008 obscure blogs and forum questions to find something useful everytime). The codes are simply for consulting purposes.
 
Also, I'll try to make references for all the sites in the beginning of the code, so it will be better to find a more detailed explanation on how it works.
