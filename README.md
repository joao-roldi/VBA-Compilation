# Excel VBA Compilation
Even VBA making to the top dreaded language in the recent StackOverflow survey, it's ~sadly~ very useful to my job today. 

I'm creating this repository with comands and small codes to future personal use (So I don't have to dig in 2011 blogs and questions to find something useful everytime). So this repository it's just a compilation of formulas with a little tinkery here and there.

The codes inserted here will be simple and I will not put explanations on how to use then, they are simply for consulting purpouse.
