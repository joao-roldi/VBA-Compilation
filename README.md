# Personal_Macros
As VBA it's not a trend language, but it's very useful to my job today, I'm creating this repository with comands and small codes to future personal use (So I don't have to dig in 2011 blogs and questions to find something useful everytime).

The codes inserted here will be simple, they are for consulting purpouse.
